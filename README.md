# About

Hello, I'm Alex. I'm passionate about data analytics and actively working on projects to strengthen my skills in data science and visualization. With hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, and Python, I strive to extract valuable insights from data and communicate them effectively through clear, actionable visuals. I'm excited to apply my technical and analytical expertise in an entry-level data analyst role.

During my leisure time, I love experimenting with new data analysis tools and techniques, and I’m constantly seeking chances to expand my knowledge and skills. I’m motivated by the excitement of tackling data-related challenges and the fulfillment of providing meaningful insights.

# Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
Code: Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb
=======
**Code:** [Bank Marketing Data Cleaning]()
>>>>>>> 6d46ff20480d830ffdcef8265f2bee8b22fe26e4

<<<<<<< HEAD
Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.
=======
**Description:** In this project, I am aiming to perform data cleaning upon recent marketing campaign. The bank intends to conduct additional campaigns moving forward and needs to comform data to their defined structure and data types. This will enable them to use the cleaned data I prepare to build a PostgreSQL database, which will store the current campaign’s data and facilitate seamless integration of data from future campaigns.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.
=======
**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data manipulation

**Technology:** Python Panda library


## SQL

### University Electronic Repair Database
>>>>>>> 6d46ff20480d830ffdcef8265f2bee8b22fe26e4

<<<<<<< HEAD
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.
=======
**Code:** [University Library Database Design]()
>>>>>>> 6d46ff20480d830ffdcef8265f2bee8b22fe26e4

<<<<<<< HEAD
Results: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
=======
**Description:** We aimed to create a service management database for the Information Technology Desk at the Penn State University. This database will be an efficient system to track all electronic equipment repairs entered through the ITS Desk in the university library and other service locations across campus. This system will track many aspects of the service, including tracking employee projects, device repair information, customer-employee interactions, and third party vendor contracts.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Description: The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

Results: Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
Code: Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql

Description: The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.

Skills: DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

Technology: SQL Server
