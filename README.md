# About

Hello, I'm Alex. I'm passionate about data analytics and actively working on projects to strengthen my skills in data science and visualization. With hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, and Python, I strive to extract valuable insights from data and communicate them effectively through clear, actionable visuals. I'm excited to apply my technical and analytical expertise in an entry-level data analyst role.

During my leisure time, I love experimenting with new data analysis tools and techniques, and I’m constantly seeking chances to expand my knowledge and skills. I’m motivated by the excitement of tackling data-related challenges and the fulfillment of providing meaningful insights.

# Portfolio Projects

## Python

### Bank Marketing Data Cleaning

**Code:** [Bank Marketing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/alexmu7/project-files/blob/main/BankMarketingCleaning-1.ipynb)

**Description:** In this project, I am aiming to perform data cleaning upon recent marketing campaign. The bank intends to conduct additional campaigns moving forward and needs to comform data to their defined structure and data types. This will enable them to use the cleaned data I prepare to build a PostgreSQL database, which will store the current campaign’s data and facilitate seamless integration of data from future campaigns.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data manipulation

**Technology:** Python Panda library


## SQL

### University Electronic Repair Database

**Code:** [University Library Database Design]()

**Description:** We aimed to create a service management database for the Information Technology Desk at the Penn State University. This database will be an efficient system to track all electronic equipment repairs entered through the ITS Desk in the university library and other service locations across campus. This system will track many aspects of the service, including tracking employee projects, device repair information, customer-employee interactions, and third party vendor contracts.

**Skills:** SQL Language: DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server

### Student Score Performance

**Code:** [Student Score Analysis]()

**Description:** We aimed to create a service management database for the Information Technology Desk at the Penn State University. This database will be an efficient system to track all electronic equipment repairs entered through the ITS Desk in the university library and other service locations across campus. This system will track many aspects of the service, including tracking employee projects, device repair information, customer-employee interactions, and third party vendor contracts.

**Skills:** SQL Language: DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server

# Power BI

### Financial Dashboard

**Code:** [PowerBI Project File]()

**Description:** Created and launched a comprehensive financial dashboard to track key performance metrics, including sales, profit, and unit volumes. The dashboard helped pinpoint top-performing products, business segments, and geographic regions, while also revealing how discounting trends impacted revenue. This project played a key role in identifying growth opportunities in weaker areas and supported data-driven decision-making across the business.
